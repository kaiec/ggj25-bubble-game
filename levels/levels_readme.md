We recommend you put your levels here, if your game is level-based.
If you use this template's naming convention for levels, which is "level_<nr>.tscn",
where <nr> is replaced with a concrete number, the default settings of this template are able to pick up your level.
By default, level numbers should start with 1.
To use the templates default settings for progrssing through levels, please make your level emit a "win()"-signal.
To reinstanciate a level, make your level emit a "reset()"-signal
